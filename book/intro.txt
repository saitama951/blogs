# Hello World :)

So it's been a while since I was thinking to start writing out my own blogs with
the pure purpose to gain and refine more of my knowledge and who knows one might
explore something new with this journey.

so yeah, some background about me. I'am sanjam, it would be evident from the
blog's name itself. I will have it changed in  a while (open to suggestions).
I'am a grad and currently working as a full time working professional.
I'm quite intrigued and passionate about low level stuff, that basically
comprises of X86_64 assembly, C, kernel programming and development.
I'm still learning and exploring this field.

so basically the question arises what you could expect from this blog?
well I'll start expressing stuff related to the domain and my views 
on the technology stacks and also would start with giving out deep insights
about the kernel, language etc. which would be interesting for me as well as
for you. I will try keep the blogs as simple as possible so a beginner could
catch up interests with the blog and feel free to reach out incase of rectify
at any point of time.
